Nothing valuable here, you better visit [Itoa project](https://github.com/DmitrySkiba/itoa)



JNIpp uses the power of C++ to give you better Java Native Interface.
It features wrappers for arrays and basic classes (Object, String),
exception translation, macros to simplify creation of your own wrappers
and more. See [help](http://dmitryskiba.github.com/itoa-jnipp/) for details.
